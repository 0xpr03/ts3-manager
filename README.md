TS3 Manager
===========

A modular multi-server ts3 bot running over the ts3query.
This project comes with 2 built in mods.
- Statistics Bot logging the current user amount everytime one joins/leaves.
- Rocket bot, it is meant more as a joke and will throw a user through every (non) taken channel in a blink of a second and then kick him.
